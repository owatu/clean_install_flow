# Install OS - Setup(OOBE)

## Windows

Windows 10 Home (64-bit)

### BSoD Driver/Device

**Disconnect Internet**  
Windows Update will downloads driver from Internet that causes BSoD.

BEFORE Setup Windows (OOBE) - UNTIL Disable device from Device Manager that using BSoD driver  
(device name: Intel(R) Management Engine Interface, PCI Simple Communications Controller)

If cause BSoD even disabled the device, that's ok.
You can use after once reboot.

If didn't, causes BSoD immediately after boot (RIP Windows, you were nice).  
(cause before account creation, below not working for no access to defaultaccount0)

If installed BSoD driver:

1. Wait (repeat BSoD) until boot to recovery.
1. Run command prompt
1. Execute `dism /Image:C:\ /Get-Drivers` and find BSoD driver (Hint: System, Intel, heci.inf).
1. Execute `dism /Image:C:\ /Remove-Driver:oem?.inf` to remove it.

### Local Account

I don't like link to Microsoft Account, so I use Local Account.  
There are 2 ways.

1. Disconnect Internet (done with above)
2. Dummy Account: Type "*example@example.com*" and "_password_" and get error for security.

Set username to **user**, password to _none_ (Because I don't use in outdoor).

**Tips**: Windows filesystem is case-insensitive, I have Linux experience and confused.
So cannot make "Windows.csv" (versions) and "windows.csv" (small to large)

P.S. To create this document, I inspect about BSoD driver and get BSoD sometimes. on no again im angry :(
