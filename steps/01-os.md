# Install OS - Setup(OOBE)

## Windows

### BSoD Driver/Device

**Disconnect Internet**  
Windows Update will downloads driver that cause BSoD.

BEFORE Setup Windows (OOBE) - UNTIL Disable device that using BSoD driver from Device Manager  
device name: Intel(R) Management Engine Interface, PCI Simple Communications Controller

If cause BSoD even disabled the device, that's ok.
You can use after once reboot.

If didn't, causes BSoD immediately after boot (RIP Windows, you were nice).

If installed BSoD driver:

1. Wait (repeat BSoD) until boot recovery.
1. Run command prompt
1. Execute `dism /Image:C:\ /Get-Drivers` and find BSoD driver (Hint: System, Intel, heci.inf).
1. Execute `dism /Image:C:\ /Remove-Driver:oem?.inf` to remove it.

### Local Account

I don't like link to Microsoft Account, so I use Local Account.  
There are 2 ways.

1. Disconnect Internet (done with above)
2. Dummy Account: Type "*example@example.com*" and "_password_" and get error for security.

Set username to **user**, password to _none_ (Because I don't use in outdoor).

**Tips**: Windows filesystem is case-insensitive, I have Linux experience and confused.
So cannot make "Windows.csv" (versions) and "windows.csv" (small to large)

**asd**: To create this document, inspect about BSoD driver and get BSoD sometimes. on no :( im angry
